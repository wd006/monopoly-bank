# [Monopoly Web Based Bank System](https://github.com/wd006/monopoly-bank)

This project provides a simple web-based banking interface for playing Monopoly, allowing players to manage their balances digitally.

## Description

The Monopoly Bank Application is a user-friendly web tool designed to replace physical money in Monopoly games. It allows up to four players to track their balances, make transactions, and reset the game, all within a browser.

## Features

* **Player Balance Tracking**: Displays the current balance for up to four players.
* **Add/Subtract Funds**: Players can add or subtract custom amounts from their balances.
* **Quick Add Buttons**: Includes buttons for quick addition of 2 Million (starting bonus), and multipliers for thousands (K) and millions (M).
* **Numerical Input**: A digital keypad for entering amounts.
* **Clear Last Digit**: A "Sil" (Delete) button to remove the last entered digit from the amount.
* **Persistent Storage**: Saves player balances in local storage, so data persists even if the page is closed and reopened.
* **Reset Functionality**: Allows resetting all player balances to their initial state with a confirmation prompt.

## Installation

## Usage

3.  **Perform Transaction**: Click the "+" button to add the amount to the selected player's balance, or the "-" button to subtract it.
4.  **Starting Bonus**: Click the "2M-EKLE" button to add 2,000,000 to the selected player's balance (typically for passing "Go").
5.  **Correcting Input**: Use the "Sil" button to remove the last digit from the amount input.
6.  **Reset Game**: Click the "RESET" button to set all player balances back to 15,000,000. A confirmation dialog will appear before resetting.
